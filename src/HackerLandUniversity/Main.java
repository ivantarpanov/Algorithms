//HackerLand University has the following grading policy:
//Every student receives a grade  in the inclusive range from 0 to 100.
//Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade.
//Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules:
//If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5.
//If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result wil still be a failing grade.
